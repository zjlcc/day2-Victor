## Daily Report

### **O (Observation)**
Today, I focused on learning TDD, completing corresponding exercises, designing the Mars Rover, creating the context map, and implementing basic functionality tests.

### **R (Reflection)**
Today's learning state was quite good. However, there are some discrepancies between the context map and the implementation, and the test design might not be comprehensive enough.

### **I (Insight)**
I realized that there wasn't enough comprehensive thinking when designing the context map and tests.

### **D (Decision)**
Strengthen the connection between the context map, tests, and implementation. In the upcoming exercises and assignments, aim to become more familiar with the entire workflow.
